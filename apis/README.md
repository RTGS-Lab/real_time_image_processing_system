- This directory contains two Python scripts `mngeoservices.py` and `noaaClimateData.py`, that request satellite imagery and climate data, respectively, from Minnesota Geospatial Image Service and NOAA. This directory also contains a Flask script, `flaskdemo.py`, that receives images at an endpoint and returns the first 100 bytes of those images.
